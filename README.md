# WikiDrink React Project

WikiDrink is a responsive web application that provides information about various drinks. You can explore different drinks, view their details, and even search for specific drinks.  WikiDrink is designed to work seamlessly on various devices, including desktop and mobile.

On the homepage, you can search for drinks by name or keyword. Clicking on a drink from the search results will take you to the drink's details page, where you can find information about its ingredients and instructions on how to prepare it.
